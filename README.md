# Bike Sharing

## Overview

### The overview of this project was to analyze biker data from Des Moines and create visualizations that show different interpretations of the data into our [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carter.blossey/viz/Module_15_Challenge_16743255698910/Overview?publish=yes).

## Results

### ![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png)

### Checkout Times for Users gave a key insight into the length of each ride. This visual broke this down by the hour of their trip and the volume within that time frame.

### ![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

### Similar to Checkout Times for Users, this breakdown went a step further and broke the distribution out by Gender. This allowed us to see how many of those bikes were allocated to each gender.

### ![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)

### The Trips by Weekday visual provided a look at stop time versus hour of start time. The density showed when the most traffic was.

### ![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)

### The Trips by Gender heatmap gave a an overview of stoptime by gender. The density of the map gave us a takeaway of when someone was most likely stopping their ride.

### ![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)

### The User Trips by Gender visual gave a breakdown of which type the rider was. This was also broken down by day of week and gender, shown by color density.

### ![August Peak Hours](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)

### The August Peak Hours horizontal bar chart allowed us to view the breakdown of bikes based on the hour of start time as well as any potential trends.

### ![Gender Breakdown](https://github.com/Ctblossey/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

### The Gender Breakdown pie chart allowed us to view the distribution of each gender.

## Summary

### There are a few key takeaways from this data set and the visualizations. First, The majority of rides lasted under one hour and then tailed off. Second, there was more traffic with males between 6am and 8pm daily. Finally, the start time for August peaked towards the end of the day with the 17th hour being the busiest.

### There are two additional visualizations I would recommend looking at. First being the averages for gender, given that over 50% of the riders are males. Second, I would recommend making a visualization comparing the data in August and a Spring month like March. It would be interesting to see if the data is opposite or if it is just lighter traffic.
